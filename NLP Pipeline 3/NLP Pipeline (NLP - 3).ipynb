    "## NLP Pipeline\n",
    "**NLP pipeline** refers to the sequence of steps involved in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. It typically includes processes such as text preprocessing, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, parsing, and named entity recognition. The pipeline may also involve more advanced techniques such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and machine translation. The goal of the NLP pipeline is to transform unstructured text data into structured data that can be analyzed and interpreted by machines.\n",
